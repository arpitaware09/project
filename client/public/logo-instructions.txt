To fix the missing logo errors, you need to add the following files to this directory:

1. logo192.png - A 192x192 pixel PNG image for your app icon
2. logo512.png - A 512x512 pixel PNG image for your app icon
3. favicon.ico - A favicon file for browser tabs

You can create these files using any image editing software or online tools like:
- https://favicon.io/
- https://www.canva.com/

After adding these files, rebuild and redeploy your application.
